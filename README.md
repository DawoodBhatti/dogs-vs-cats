might be able to use predict() to get the classification probability. though for a binary classification problem this means be a zero  probability i.e. 60% probability of a dog means 40% probability of it being a cat so we could just say that if our probability returned is less than 80% we classify it as an unknown else use the classification from predict...

could generalise to a class classification problem using: https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-make-classification-and-regression-predictions-for-deep-learning-models-in-keras/?
