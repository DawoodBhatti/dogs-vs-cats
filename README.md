# dogs-vs-cats

_Note: if you are just interested in running this program: go to release/run_classifier.py
_

I followed this tutorial: https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-convolutional-neural-network-to-classify-photos-of-dogs-and-cats/ to create a classification program that can be run in two ways. 

The first is a manual 'drag and drop' interface and the second lets you run classification on an entire folder to then provide you classification output as txt/csv files in the selected folder.

three main branches in this repo:

1) build aka construction (messy mixing bowl)

2) dist is the finished product (finished cake)

3) release is the product in a gift-wrapped box (cake in a box handed to someone with a card)
