with the addition of a 'drag and drop' interface and options to select a file or an entire folder

might be able to use predict() to get the classification probability. though for a binary classification problem this means be a zero  probability i.e. 60% probability of a dog means 40% probability of it being a cat so we could just say that if our probability returned is less than 80% we classify it as an unknown else use the classification from predict...

could generalise to a class classification problem using: https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-make-classification-and-regression-predictions-for-deep-learning-models-in-keras/?

upload final program as an executable which doesn't require any python installations or packages?

can use pyinstaller

So, build is for construction, dist is your finished product, and release is your gift-wrapped box for the world. Think of it like baking:

build is the messy mixing bowl

dist is your finished cake

release is when you put that cake in a lovely box and hand it to someone with a smile
